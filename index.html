      <h1>Hi, I'm Andrew Chuang.</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      I'm currently a fourth-year undergraduate at The University of Chicago 
      majoring in mathematics and economics and graduating in June 2018.
      I'm moving to San Francisco, CA in August 2018 to start at Charles River 
      Associates as an Analyst in the Antitrust and Competition Economics practice.
