    <p>
      I'm currently a fourth-year undergraduate at The University of Chicago 
      majoring in mathematics and economics and graduating in June 2018. I'm 
      moving to the Bay Area in August 2018 to start at Charles River 
      Associates as an Analyst in the Antitrust and Competition Economics practice. 
      My academic interests include abstract algebra, health-care economics,
      and labor economics. 
      My current extracurricular interests include programming, weight-lifting,
      rowing, skiing and baking pies.
