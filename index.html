    <p>
      I'm currently a fourth-year undergraduate at The University of Chicago 
      majoring in mathematics and economics and graduating in June 2018.     
      <br> I'm moving to the Bay Area in August 2018 to start at Charles River 
      Associates as an Analyst in the Antitrust and Competition Economics practice. 
      <br>
      My academic interests include abstract algebra, computational linguistics, health-care economics,
      and labor economics. 
      My current extracurricular interests include programming, weight-lifting,
      rowing, skiing and baking pies.
